# General Project Overview

## Project Overview

This project is an automated setup system for an IoT Control System designed for a Raspberry Pi 5. It aims to streamline the process of configuring and deploying a comprehensive IoT environment, including network setup, security measures, data management, application layers, IoT communication protocols, and system monitoring.

Key goals of the project:
1. Automate the setup process for a complex IoT system
2. Ensure secure communication and robust data management
3. Provide a flexible and extensible platform for various IoT applications
4. Implement monitoring and maintenance capabilities for system health

Potential use cases include:
- Smart home automation systems
- Industrial IoT applications for manufacturing and process control
- Environmental monitoring and data collection
- Smart agriculture and precision farming
- Remote system management and control

- **export_project_files_content.sh**: Script for exporting project file contents to Markdown files.
- **credentials.env**: Contains sensitive information and configuration settings.
- **modules/*.sh**: Individual setup scripts for different components of the system (e.g., backend, database, MQTT, VPN).
- **utils/*.sh**: Utility scripts for error handling and logging.
- **README.md**: Overview and documentation of the project.
- **system_check.sh**: Script for performing system checks.

## Usage Instructions

1. **System Setup**: Run the main setup script to configure the IoT Control System:
   ```bash
   sudo ./setup_iot_system.sh
   ```
   This script will guide you through the setup process for various components.

2. **Export Project Files**: Use the export script to generate documentation:
   ```bash
   sudo ./export_project_files_content.sh
   ```
   This will create Markdown files in the `docs/md/` directory.

3. **System Check**: Perform a system check using:
   ```bash
   sudo ./system_check.sh
   ```

4. **System Restart**: Restart system components or the entire system:
   ```bash
   sudo ./system_restart.sh
   ```

5. **Configuration**: Edit the `credentials.env` file to set up your specific configuration before running the main setup script.

6. **Module Customization**: Individual module scripts in the `modules/` directory can be edited to customize specific components of the system.

7. **Monitoring**: After setup, access the Grafana dashboard (default port 3000) for system monitoring.

8. **Code Export for AI**: To export code for AI analysis:
   ```bash
   ./export_code.sh
   ```

## Metadata and File Usage

Each exported file in the `docs/md/` directory contains metadata, including:
- Export Date
- Original File Path
- Reference to this General Project Overview

When using or referencing these files, always consult this `general_project_overview.md` document for comprehensive project details and context.

Remember to keep the `credentials.env` file secure and not share it publicly, as it contains sensitive information.
